	abstract = {We observed a full-orbit phase curve of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b with MIRI/LRS as part of the Transiting Exoplanet Community Early Release Science Program. Here we report preliminary findings for the instrument performance from the team's MIRI Working Group. Overall we find that MIRI's performance for phase curve observations is excellent, with a few minor caveats. The key takeaways for Cycle 2 planning with MIRI/LRS are: (1) long-duration observations (\&gt; 24 hours) have now been successfully executed; (2) for phase curves, we recommend including a one-hour burn-in period prior to taking science data to mitigate the effects of the ramp systematic; and (3) we do not yet recommend partial phase curve observations. In addition, we also find that: the position of the spectrum on the detector is stable to within 0.03 pixels over the full 26.5-hour observation; the light curves typically show a systematic downward ramp that is strongest for the first 30 minutes, but continues to decay for hours; from 10.6-11.8 microns, the ramp effect has remarkably different behavior, possibly due to a different illumination history for the affected region of the detector; after trimming the integrations most affected by the initial ramps and correcting the remaining systematics with analytic models, we obtain residuals to the light-curve fits that are typically within 25\% of the photon noise limit for 0.5-micron spectroscopic bins; non-linearity correction is not a significant source of additional noise for WASP-43, though it may be an issue for brighter targets; the gain value of 5.5 electrons/DN currently on CRDS and JDox is known to be incorrect, and the current best estimate for the gain is approximately 3.1 electrons/DN; new reference files for the JWST calibration pipeline reflecting these findings are under development at STScI.},
