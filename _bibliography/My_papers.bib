              Hot Jupiters are among the best-studied exoplanets, but it is still poorly understood how their chemical composition and cloud properties vary with longitude. Theoretical models predict that clouds may condense on the nightside and that molecular abundances can be driven out of equilibrium by zonal winds. Here we report a phase-resolved emission spectrum of the hot Jupiter WASP-43b measured from 5 μm to 12 μm with the JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument. The spectra reveal a large day–night temperature contrast (with average brightness temperatures of 1,524 ± 35 K and 863 ± 23 K, respectively) and evidence for water absorption at all orbital phases. Comparisons with three-dimensional atmospheric models show that both the phase-curve shape and emission spectra strongly suggest the presence of nightside clouds that become optically thick to thermal emission at pressures greater than {\textasciitilde}100 mbar. The dayside is consistent with a cloudless atmosphere above the mid-infrared photosphere. Contrary to expectations from equilibrium chemistry but consistent with disequilibrium kinetics models, methane is not detected on the nightside (2
              σ
              upper limit of 1–6 ppm, depending on model assumptions). Our results provide strong evidence that the atmosphere of WASP-43b is shaped by disequilibrium processes and provide new insights into the properties of the planet’s nightside clouds. However, the remaining discrepancies between our observations and our predictive atmospheric models emphasize the importance of further exploring the effects of clouds and disequilibrium chemistry in numerical models.},

              We analyse unpublished
              Spitzer
              observations of the thermal phase-curve of WASP-121 b, a benchmark ultra-hot Jupiter.
            
            
              Methods.
              We adopted the wavelet pixel-independent component analysis technique to remove challenging instrumental systematic effects in these datasets and we fit them simultaneously with parametric light-curve models. We also performed phase-curve retrievals to better understand the horizontal and vertical thermal structure of the planetary atmosphere.
            
            
              Results.
              We measured planetary brightness temperatures of {\textasciitilde}2700 K (dayside) and {\textasciitilde}700–1100 K (nightside), along with modest peak offsets of 5.9° ± 1.6 (3.6 µm) and 5.0°
              −3.1
              +3.4
              (4.5 µm) after mid-eclipse. These results suggest inefficient heat redistribution in the atmosphere of WASP-121 b. The inferred atmospheric Bond albedo and circulation efficiency align well with observed trends for hot giant exoplanets. Interestingly, the measured peak offsets correspond to a westward hot spot, which has rarely been observed. We also report consistent transit depths at 3.6 and 4.5 µm, along with updated geometric and orbital parameters. Finally, we compared our
              Spitzer
              results with previous measurements, including recent JWST observations.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              We extracted new information on the thermal properties and dynamics of an exoplanet atmosphere from an especially problematic dataset. This study probes the reliability of exoplanet phase-curve parameters obtained from
              Spitzer
              observations when state-of-the-art pipelines are adopted to remove the instrumental systematic effects. It demonstrates that
              Spitzer
              phase-curve observations provide a useful baseline for comparison with JWST observations, and shows the increase in parameters precision achieved with the newer telescope.},

              We present a comprehensive analysis of the Hubble Space Telescope observations of the atmosphere of WASP-121 b, an ultra-hot Jupiter. After reducing the transit, eclipse, and phase-curve observations with a uniform methodology and addressing the biases from instrument systematics, sophisticated atmospheric retrievals are used to extract robust constraints on the thermal structure, chemistry, and cloud properties of the atmosphere. Our analysis shows that the observations are consistent with a strong thermal inversion beginning at ∼10

              hotspot
              offset between the two phase curves and (ii) varying spectral signatures in the transits and eclipses. By simulating the global dynamics of WASP-121 b's atmosphere at high resolution, we show that the identified signals are consistent with quasiperiodic weather patterns, hence atmospheric variability, with signatures at the level probed by the observations (∼5\% to ∼10\%) that change on a timescale of ∼5 planet days; in the simulations, the weather patterns arise from the formation and movement of storms and fronts, causing hot (as well as cold) patches of atmosphere to deform, separate, and mix in time.},

Here we report preliminary findings for the instrument performance from the team's MIRI Working Group. Overall we find that MIRI's performance for phase curve observations is excellent, with a few minor caveats. The key takeaways for Cycle 2 planning with MIRI/LRS are: (1) long-duration observations (\&gt; 24 hours) have now been successfully executed; (2) for phase curves, we recommend including a one-hour burn-in period prior to taking science data to mitigate the effects of the ramp systematic; and (3) we do not yet recommend partial phase curve observations. In addition, we also find that: the position of the spectrum on the detector is stable to within 0.03 pixels over the full 26.5-hour observation; the light curves typically show a systematic downward ramp that is strongest for the first 30 minutes, but continues to decay for hours; from 10.6-11.8 microns, the ramp effect has remarkably different behavior, possibly due to a different illumination history for the affected region of the detector; after trimming the integrations most affected by the initial ramps and correcting the remaining systematics with analytic models, we obtain residuals to the light-curve fits that are typically within 25\% of the photon noise limit for 0.5-micron spectroscopic bins; non-linearity correction is not a significant source of additional noise for WASP-43, though it may be an issue for brighter targets; the gain value of 5.5 electrons/DN currently on CRDS and JDox is known to be incorrect, and the current best estimate for the gain is approximately 3.1 electrons/DN; new reference files for the JWST calibration pipeline reflecting these findings are under development at STScI.},

              . The
              James Webb
              Space Telescope (JWST) has now started its exploration of exoplanetary worlds. In particular, the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) with its Low-Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) carries out transit, eclipse, and phase-curve spectroscopy of exoplanetary atmospheres with an unprecedented precision in a so far almost uncharted wavelength range.
            
            
              Aims
              . The precision and significance in the detection of molecules in exoplanetary atmospheres relies on a thorough understanding of the instrument itself and on accurate data reduction methods. This paper aims to provide a clear description of the instrumental systematics that affect observations of transiting exoplanets through the use of simulations.
            
            
              Methods
              . We carried out realistic simulations of transiting-exoplanet observations with the MIRI LRS instrument that included the model of the exoplanet system, the optical path of the telescope, the MIRI detector performances, and instrumental systematics and drifts that could alter the atmospheric features we are meant to detect in the data. After we introduce our pipeline, we show its performance on the transit of L 168-9b, a super-Earth-sized exoplanet observed during the commissioning of the MIRI instrument.

              . This paper provides a better understanding of the data themselves and of the best practices in terms of reduction and analysis through comparisons between simulations and real data. We show that simulations validate the current data-analysis methods. Simulations also highlight instrumental effects that impact the accuracy of our current spectral extraction techniques. These simulations are proven to be essential in the preparation of JWST observation programs and help us to assess the detectability of various atmospheric and surface scenarios.},

	abstract = {Gravity modes (
              g
              modes), mixed gravito-acoustic modes (mixed modes), and gravito-inertial modes (
              gi
              modes) possess unmatched properties as probes for stars with radiative interiors. The structural and dynamical constraints that they are able to provide cannot be accessed by other means. While they provide precious insights into the internal dynamics of evolved stars as well as massive and intermediate-mass stars, their non-detection in main sequence (MS) solar-type stars make them a crucial missing piece in our understanding of angular momentum transport in radiative zones and stellar rotational evolution. In this work, we aim to apply certain analysis tools originally developed for helioseismology in order to look for
              g
              -mode signatures in MS solar-type stars. We select a sample of the 34 most promising MS solar-type stars with
              Kepler
              four-year long photometric time series. All these stars are well-characterised late F-type stars with thin convective envelopes, fast convective flows, and stochastically excited acoustic modes (
              p
              modes). For each star, we compute the background noise level of the Fourier power spectrum to identify significant peaks at low frequency. After successfully detecting individual peaks in 12 targets, we further analyse four of them and observe distinct patterns of surrounding peaks with a low probability of being noise artifacts. Comparisons with the predictions from reference models suggest that these patterns are compatible with the presence of non-asymptotic low-order pure
              g
              modes, pure
              p
              modes, and mixed modes. Given their sensitivity to both the convective core interface stratification and the coupling between
              p
              - and
              g
              -mode resonant cavities, such modes are able to provide strong constraints on the structure and evolutionary states of the related targets. Considering the granulation and activity background of the stars in our sample, we subsequently compute the corresponding mode velocity necessary to trigger a detectable luminosity fluctuation. We use it to estimate the surface velocity, ⟨
              v
              r
              ⟩, of the candidate modes we have detected. In this case, we find ⟨
              v
              r
              ⟩∼10 cm s
              −1
              . These results could be extremely useful for characterising the deep interior of MS solar-type stars, as the upcoming PLATO mission will considerably expand the size of the available working sample.},
