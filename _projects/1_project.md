In collaboration with the MIRI Guaranteed-time observation team, we have conducted the first mid-infrared detection of sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere of WASP-107b, a very low-density super-Neptune at the edge of the Neptunian desert, extending the temperature range of exoplanets exhibiting detected SO<sub>2</sub> from ∼1200 K down to ∼740 K (Rustamkulov et al., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05677-y">2023</a>; Tsai et al., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05902-2">2023</a>). The work conducted on atmospheric retrievals not only indicates the prevalence of <strong>photochemistry</strong> in the upper atmosphere but also reveals the presence of silicate clouds. This work leaves open questions regarding the role of <strong>disequilibrium chemistry</strong> in the atmosphere of this super-Neptune. The study of photochemistry is therefore a strong entry point to understanding the upper atmospheric irradiation processes that govern such transitional planets.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Most of detected exoplanets orbit really close to their star, undeniably facing <strong>strong irradiation conditions</strong>. Due to this irradiation, low mass planets such as Neptune-like ones are likely to face atmospheric escape and a drastic increase of their atmospheric scale height. The non-trivial link between irradiation, planetary gravity, temperature and chemistry at work in the upper atmosphere has never been made through observation. In that context, the accepted JWST cycle 2 proposal  <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=2950">(PID 2950)</a>, that I am associated with, will sound the presence of photochemistry in the atmosphere of 3 exoplanets, experiencing different irradiation conditions. Using the refractory nature of sulphur we will start constraining the elemental ratios (Turrini et al., <a href="http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10686-014-9401-6">2021</a>). Next step is to obsreve cooler irradiated transitional planets to sound their full phase-curve (when the planet emission is tracked along an entire orbit) in search of photochemistry on the day-side and clouds on the night-side.
